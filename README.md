Description
****************************
The name of my term project is Hourglass. Hourglass is a personal time-management companion designed to help students, working professionals, or anyone who needs more time in their life to optimize their busy schedules. The program takes the stress out of having to worry about deadlines and daily tasks by automatically distributing working time over a given period before the deadline of that specific assignment. Hourglass can also keep track of its usersâ€™ weekly habits, helping to adjust schedules around things like eating lunch, working out, or attending classes. With a user-friendly interface and smart algorithms, Hourglass is the ultimate tool for achieving an exceptional work-life balance.

How to Run
****************************
In order to run Hourglass, simply run the "Hourglass.py" file. Earlier versions of Hourglass are found within the repository.
